  "description": "In partnership with director, Alfred Marroquin, our approach broke out of the confinement of 2020 and entered an ethereal new world. It was an homage to SZA's first album, CTRL, and a celebration of music, spirit, and the earth itself. Captured live and in one take, it featured three chapters, 15 tracks, and cameos by Isaiah Rashad and Travis Scott â€” who became a buzzworthy surprise after SZA tweeted an invitation to join her just days before shooting. We released behind the scenes NFT's that sold out immediately on our partner platform, fanaply.com",
