    "headline": "Chunks World is an ongoing generative PFP project that brings 48x48x48 characters to life. Each Chunk part is designed as 'plates' and then assembled together via code to create a unique character. The project is built in Python and uses the Blender API to render the characters. I started this project 2 years ago, and have since launched 2 sold out NFT collections (amasing over 2 million USD in trade volume) using this generative process and code as the engine. I designed and coded all components of this system.",
