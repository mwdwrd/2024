The branded gesture is now influencing the actual product UI and Google's most iconic product: search.",

It was an homage to SZA's first album, CTRL, and a celebration of music, spirit, and the earth itself. Captured live and in one take, it featured three chapters, 15 tracks, and cameos by Isaiah Rashad and Travis Scott — who became a buzzworthy surprise after SZA tweeted an invitation to join her just days before shooting.
